      <h4> Create an Account</h4>
      <p>
          To create an account: Enter your Player Name, and, optionally a Password.  Usernames must be unique. <em>(NOTE: Passwords are not secure, Do NOT use a real password).</em>
      </p>
      <p>Creating an account allows you to access your cumulative statistics.</p>
      <p>Creating a Password gives you flimsy protection against someone pretending to be you and wrecking all your stats by throwing Sponge 50 times in a row.<p>
      <h5> OR</h5>
      <h4>Sign In</h4>
      <p>
          If you already have an account, log-in with your Player Name (and Password, if you created one).
